# 🚀 dbt MCP Hackathon Project: AI-Powered dbt Assistant with Real MCP Integration

*From hackathon prototype to production-ready MCP server*

## 🎯 The Vision

What if you could talk to your dbt project like you talk to a colleague? "Show me all customer models" or "Create a daily revenue analysis combining our jaffle shop and flower shop data." That's exactly what we built - an AI-powered dbt assistant that makes data modeling as conversational as asking a question.

## 🏗️ The Final Architecture

We built a production-ready system that implements the official Model Context Protocol (MCP) with intelligent AI integration:

- **Maintained Protocol**: Benefits from community MCP development

## 🛠️ How We Built It: The Technology Journey

### Phase 1: The Foundation - "Getting Our Data House in Order"

**🗄️ The Data Layer (DuckDB + dbt)**
We started with real business data - two companies that needed analytics:
- **Jaffle Shop**: A coffee business with customers, orders, and store locations
- **Flower Shop**: A flower delivery service with arrangements and delivery data

*Why DuckDB?* It's like SQLite but for analytics - perfect for hackathons because it's fast, embedded, and doesn't need a server.

*Why dbt?* Because we wanted to show real dbt workflows, not toy examples. We built 19 production-ready models across staging, intermediate, and mart layers.

### Phase 2: The Brain - "Official MCP Server with AI Intelligence"

**🧠 The Real MCP Server (Official Protocol + Python)**
This is where the magic happens. We built a standards-compliant MCP server using the official `mcp` library - a universal interface between AI agents and dbt operations.

**Key Services We Built:**
- `real_mcp_server.py`: Official MCP server with JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol
- `model_service.py`: "Hey, show me all my customer models" (reads dbt manifest.json)
- `compilation_service.py`: "Does this SQL actually work?" (runs dbt compile/run)
- `chatgpt_service.py`: "Turn this English into SQL" (OpenAI GPT-4 integration)
- `ai_service.py`: "Backup AI system" (pattern-based fallback for reliability)
- `model_generator.py`: "Create a new model from scratch" (writes .sql files)

**The AI Intelligence:** We built a production-ready dual AI system:
- **Primary**: OpenAI GPT-4 with comprehensive dbt context and best practices
- **Fallback**: Pattern-recognition system for reliability and zero-cost operation
- **Smart Integration**: Seamlessly works within MCP tool calls
- **dbt Expertise**: Both systems understand your project structure, dependencies, and conventions

*Why Official MCP?* Standards compliance means any AI agent can connect to our server, and we benefit from the growing MCP ecosystem.

### Phase 3: The Face - "Intelligent Frontend with Real-Time AI"

**🎨 The Frontend (Streamlit + AI Integration)**
We built a comprehensive single-file Streamlit application that provides a complete dbt AI assistant experience:

- **Intelligent Model Explorer**: Browse, search, and filter your 68 dbt models with real-time compilation and execution
- **AI-Powered Chat Interface**: Natural language conversations that generate actual dbt models using ChatGPT
- **Real-Time Model Generation**: Ask "create a model to show total tax_amt for jaffle_orders" and get working SQL instantly
- **Backend Integration**: Smart connection management with both MCP server and legacy FastAPI endpoints
- **Production Features**: Model compilation, execution, lineage visualization, and AI status monitoring

*Why This Architecture?* Single-file deployment eliminates import issues while providing enterprise-grade functionality. The chat interface actually generates real dbt models, not just generic responses.

## 🔄 The User Experience: Production-Ready AI Workflows

### "Show Me My Models" - The MCP-Powered Exploration Flow

    │   ├─ Best practices and conventions
    │   ├─ Sophisticated SQL generation (3-5s)
    │   └─ High confidence, production-ready code
    │
    └─ Fallback: Pattern-Based AI
        ├─ Instant response if OpenAI unavailable
        ├─ Template-based generation (<200ms)
        └─ Reliable basic functionality
    ↓
📝 Generated SQL → User Review → Optional Save → dbt Integration
```

**The magic moment:** You go from natural language to production-ready dbt model in under 10 seconds, with full AI explanation and guidance.

## 🔌 The Communication Layer: Official MCP Protocol

**Production Implementation:** We built a **real MCP server** using the official MCP protocol with JSON-RPC 2.0 communication. Here's our production architecture:

### Our Official MCP Server:
- `list_models`: "Show me everything in this dbt project with filtering and search"
- `get_model_details`: "Tell me about this specific model with full metadata"
- `generate_model`: "Create new SQL from natural language using ChatGPT"
- `compile_model`: "Check if this SQL is valid using dbt compile"
- `run_model`: "Execute this model and show me results"
- `get_model_lineage`: "Show me model dependencies and relationships"

### Why We Use Official MCP:
1. **Standards Compliance**: Works with any MCP-compatible AI agent
2. **Future-Proof**: Benefits from growing MCP ecosystem
3. **Universal Compatibility**: Claude, ChatGPT, Kiro IDE, and more
4. **Community Support**: Maintained protocol with ongoing improvements

**What Our MCP Server Actually Looks Like:**
```python
# Real MCP Server Implementation
from mcp.server import Server
from mcp.server.stdio import stdio_server
from mcp.types import Tool, Resource, TextContent

# User says: "Create a customer analysis model"
# AI Agent sends MCP tool call:
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": {
        "name": "generate_model",
        "arguments": {
            "prompt": "Create customer analysis model",
            "materialization": "view",
            "business_context": "E-commerce analytics"
        }
    }
}

# MCP Server returns structured response:
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "result": {
        "content": [
            {
                "type": "text",
                "text": "✅ Generated SQL:\n```sql\nselect * from {{ ref('customers') }}...\n```"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

### Dual Architecture Benefits:
- **MCP Server**: For AI agents and standards compliance (`mcp_main.py`)
- **FastAPI Server**: For Streamlit frontend and backward compatibility (`main.py`)
- **Shared Services**: Both use the same AI and dbt integration services
- **Flexible Deployment**: Choose the right interface for your use case
